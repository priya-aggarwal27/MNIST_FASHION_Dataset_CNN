# MNIST_FASHION_Dataset_CNN
## Problem Statement
Train a simple CNN on the Fashion MNIST dataset using Tensorflow Keras.

Install Keras Tuner library to get hyperparameters of CNN model like No of Filters, Filter Size and Learning Rate of Adam Optimizer.

Requirement for keras Tuner is:

Python : 3.6
Tensorflow: 2.0

The Fashion MNIST dataset including:

*   60,000 training examples
*   10,000 testing examples
*   10 classes
*   28Ã—28 grayscale images

The mapping of all 0-9 integers to class labels is listed below.
```
0: T-shirt/top
1: Trouser
2: Pullover
3: Dress
4: Coat
5: Sandal
6: Shirt
7: Sneaker
8: Bag
9: Ankle boot
```
